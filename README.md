# FoodChapChap

FoodChapChap is a food ordering application that allows cafeterias in organisations such as company buildings, malls, universities and more to sign up as vendors on the application. Customers can then search for available vendors and place orders, specifying the time in which they will pick up the order, using OrderIDs as verification for their order.

# Problem Statement

University cafeterias often experience long queues during peak break times, causing delays and inconvenience for students and staff. Limited break periods make it challenging for them to order, pay, and enjoy their meals without rushing. This results in inefficient use of time and dissatisfaction with the dining experience.

To tackle this issue, Food Chapchap was developed to reduce wait times by allowing users to browse menus, place orders, and complete payments in advance. The app thus ensures a faster, more convenient dining experience for everyone.
