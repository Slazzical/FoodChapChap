# FoodChapChap
Description
FoodChapChap is a food ordering application that allows cafeterias in organisations such as company buildings, malls, universities and more to sign up as vendors on the application. Customers can then search for available vendors and place orders, specifying the time in which they will pick up the order, using OrderIDs as verification for their order.
